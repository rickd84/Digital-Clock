# Digital-Clock
Resizable digital clock with JavaFX

This project is a simple digital clock that is resizable.  To make the clock increase in size press the up arrow key, 
and to make it decrease in size press the down arrow key.
Dijgi2.java uses JavaFX and the gregorian calendar to show the month, date, day of the week, and time.
Digi.java is the driver and users event handlers to resize the clock window.
